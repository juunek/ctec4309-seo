    <!-- SUMMARY -->
      <div id="goto01">
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Summary.</p>
      </div>

    <!-- Organic Ranking -->
      <div id="goto02">
        <h2>Organic Ranking and Search Results</h2>
        <p>Organic search results are the results that show without paid advertising in which rankings are earned through effective SEO. (Muller, n.d.b) Search engines crawl, or look over the code/content for each URL they encounter to find new and updated content. Content varies from “a webpage, an image, a video, a PDF, etc.” This content is added to their index, or URL database, to look through when someone does a search. When someone does a search, the search engine looks through their index and displays the results, ranked by relevance.</p>
        <p>One factor in organic search results is the searcher’s location. Google also takes into consideration the popularity or prominence of a business. The number and sentiment or positivity of these reviews also notably affect the organic ranking. (Muller, n.d.a)</p>
      </div>

    <!-- Keywords -->
      <div id="goto03">
        <h2>Keywords and Current Ranking</h2>
        <p>[Rankings are keyword specific. (Here the term, "keywords", is also used to refer to key phrases.) In this section, you should report on how and why you decide on the keywords that the client should focus on. You should utilize online keyword selection tools provided by Google, Bing, and others to gather keyword statistics (ex. search volume and base your keyword selection on those statistics. In addition, in this section, you should also report on the current rankings of your client based on the keywords you selected (i.e. reporting on which result page -- 3rd, 7th, or beyond 10th, etc. -- the client's site shows up). Note that you need to select at least three keywords.]</p>

    <!-- Analysis -->
      <div id="goto04">
        <h2>Analysis of Current Web Pages</h2>
        <p>text</p>
      </div>

    <!-- Inbound Links -->
      <div id="goto05">
        <h2>Inbound Links and Other SEO Recommendations</h2>
        <p>Based on these sites and their number of links it is recommended to double the number of backlinks in the very least, giving a total of 616. This would make the organic ranking competitive amongst the most direct competition.</p>
        <p>Currently, the company does not have a blog. The blog link in the footer navigation is not a working link and simply goes to a “book now” page. Implementing a blog would help greatly in securing more inbound links from credible sources like other blogs. It is also good to note that the top competitor and the one with the most backlinks have their own blog.</p> <p>Developing the blog would help with inbound links by using partnerships with other blogs. Agreeing to guest write articles about deep cleaning and other cleaning content for other home improvement and cleaning blogs. Another strategy could be linking to other blogs in the articles as well. The partnerships would help foster relationship development and increase the number of inbound links without having to pay for them.</p>
      </div>

    <!-- Traffic Boosting -->
      <div id="goto06">
        <h2>Traffic Boosting Ideas</h2>
        <p>Developing the blog as mentioned, would help the company with more than just increasing the number of inbound links. It would also increase traffic in general. Blogs provide a great place to include keywords in articles in a way that avoids keyword stuffing. It helps your site rank for trending keywords weekly as you release new articles with timely topics. It also helps to establish a community around the people who read the articles regularly, these people then turn into loyal customers as they are more familiar with your brand and more likely to trust you. It also ads a humanized element to the company as a whole.</p>
        <p>With the blog, you can also include a button to “pin” the articles. This then helps to expand your audience into a social media platform with highly engaged users. Pinterest is the perfect platform for house cleaning blogs and services.</p>
