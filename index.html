      <div id="goto02">
        <h2>Organic Ranking and Search Results</h2>
        <p>Organic search results are the results that show without paid advertising in which rankings are earned through effective SEO. (Muller, n.d.b) Search engines crawl, or look over the code/content for each URL they encounter to find new and updated content. Content varies from “a webpage, an image, a video, a PDF, etc.” This content is added to their index, or URL database, to look through when someone does a search. When someone does a search, the search engine looks through their index and displays the results, ranked by relevance.</p>
        <p>One factor in organic search results is the searcher’s location. Google also takes into consideration the popularity or prominence of a business. The number and sentiment or positivity of these reviews also notably affect the organic ranking. (Muller, n.d.a)</p>

    <!-- Keywords -->

        <h2>Keywords and Current Ranking</h2>
        <p>According to Google Trends, these keywords and terms/phrases had the highest level of interest (in order):
          <ol>
            <li>housekeeping texas</li>
            <li>dallas housekeeping</li>
            <li>highland park housekeeping</li>
            <li>clean home dallas</li>
          </ol>
        </p>

        <p>These keywords and terms/phrases had zero interest:
            <ul class="columns" data-columns="2">
              <li>home cleaner dallas</li>

              <li>highland park house keeping</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>This research shows the nuances of words that we need to pay attention to. People are not searching for “house keeping” or “cleaner”—”housekeeping” is what has the highest level of interest.</p>

        <p>This is where Highland Park Housekeeping ranks organically when we search the most popular keywords.</p>

    <!-- Inbound Links -->
      <div id="goto05">
        <h2>Inbound Links and Other SEO Recommendations</h2>
        <p>Based on these sites and their number of links it is recommended to double the number of backlinks in the very least, giving a total of 616. This would make the organic ranking competitive amongst the most direct competition.</p>
        <p>Currently, the company does not have a blog. The blog link in the footer navigation is not a working link and simply goes to a “book now” page. Implementing a blog would help greatly in securing more inbound links from credible sources like other blogs. It is also good to note that the top competitor and the one with the most backlinks have their own blog.</p> <p>Developing the blog would help with inbound links by using partnerships with other blogs. Agreeing to guest write articles about deep cleaning and other cleaning content for other home improvement and cleaning blogs. Another strategy could be linking to other blogs in the articles as well. The partnerships would help foster relationship development and increase the number of inbound links without having to pay for them.</p>

    <!-- Traffic Boosting -->
      <div id="goto06">
        <h2>Traffic Boosting Ideas</h2>
        <p>Developing the blog as mentioned, would help the company with more than just increasing the number of inbound links. It would also increase traffic in general. Blogs provide a great place to include keywords in articles in a way that avoids keyword stuffing. It helps your site rank for trending keywords weekly as you release new articles with timely topics. It also helps to establish a community around the people who read the articles regularly, these people then turn into loyal customers as they are more familiar with your brand and more likely to trust you. It also ads a humanized element to the company as a whole.</p>
        <p>With the blog, you can also include a button to “pin” the articles. This then helps to expand your audience into a social media platform with highly engaged users. Pinterest is the perfect platform for house cleaning blogs and services.</p>
